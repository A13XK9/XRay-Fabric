# Advanced XRay (Fabric Edition)
Fabric Loader based XRay mod designed to aid players who don't like the ore searching process. This mod is an exact 1:1 copy of my [Advanced XRay Forge Mod](https://github.com/MichaelHillcox/XRay-Mod/) which is typically the more up-to-date version of the mod.

## Disclaimer
I am a Forge Mod developer, not a Fabric Mod Developer, I am doing this mod per user request and out of pure intrest in learning a new API. The current status of this mod is `Unreleased` as the mod is currently a WIP. I will only support Fabric support MC versions and I will attempt to continue to support this mod going forwards. This mod is currently based on Fabric for `1.16.1`. You have been notified :D

## Feature
Advanced XRay Mod for Fabric is a feature rich XRay / Block ESP mod designed to aid players in the Ore searching process. I personally do not see it as cheating and thus maintain the mod as if it is a legitimate Minecraft enchancement mod. With this I've designed it to be as user friendly as possible. Out of the box you'll have *Easy to use GUI for adding, deleting and editing block you want to find*, *Full RGB color picker support*, *Searchable block list with in-hand and in-world options for adding blocks*, *Json Stored list to share and edit easily outside of the game*.

## How to use

### Using XRay

- Press `[Default] Backslash` to toggle Xray on and off
- Press `[Default] Z` to open the in-game GUI

### Adding Ores

- Open the GUI Editor pressing `[Default] Z`
- Select the method you'd like to use to add a block, either From hand, What you can see, or By searching a list
- Modify the Name, Color, and anything else you'd like to change
- Click add and Enable the Block

### Editing Ores

- Shift Right click on any item in the GUI and edit as needed
- Click save and the changed will be applied

## Use on public servers

**note on use of the mod on servers:** I want to make this very clear, I **DO NOT** support using this mod on servers, if you create an issue and I see you've tried to join a server, I will close the issue. This mod is only maintained because I personally use it for myself, on my own worlds. Do not break other servers rules, they are there because the owners want you to play a specific way, respect that or plan on a different server.
